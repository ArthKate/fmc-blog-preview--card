- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

- I have learned how to pseudo classes to toggle states on a link.
- I have also learned how to apply shadows particularly the box-shadow for this project.


```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
  a:hover
  a:active {
    color: var(--yellow);
    transition: all 0.02s ease-in;
  }
```

### Continued development

Am going to focus on learning css to be conversant with responsive web development in order to appreciate css frameworks that I might later use in my learning journey to be come a fullstack web developer
